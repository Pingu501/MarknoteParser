# MarkNote Parser

A high performance markdown parser implemented in Swift.

## Purpose

Currently my app [MarkNote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marknote/id991297585?ls=1&mt=8) is using [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to render markdown as HTML.   
After trying to find a relevant markdown parser in Swfit/Object-c while no result, I decided to build my own.


## Status

This parser has not yet completed yet, and only have some very basic markdown features yet.    
I am still heavily working on it.
